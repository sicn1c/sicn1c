Experienced Media Professional | Technophile

I am an accomplished communicator with extensive experience in news media production, brand management, digital communications, social media management, analytics monitoring, and strategic planning and implementation. I'm a proven newsroom leader with strong journalistic, analytical, and data-driven decision-making skills.

Currently I serve as the social media coordinator at the University of California, Davis. A polymath by nature, I create and produce multi-media content on a wide variety of topics from primary research and science to student life and the university experience. I'm comfortable working in matrixed organizations and teams, establishing and maintaining diverse partnerships.

I am committed to promoting diversity and equity in public relations and higher education.
